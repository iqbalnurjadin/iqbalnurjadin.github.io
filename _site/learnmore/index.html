  <h2>VISION</h2>
  <p>
    Our vision for Spark Social Impact is to demonstrate to students & young professionals that purposeful careers are no longer isolated to the nonprofit sphere. We believe exposure to the variety of impact-driven careers is key to incentivizing more young professionals to engage with the field.
  </p>
  <p class="about-paragraph">
    Our website consolidates information on organizations dedicated to social impact through entrepreneurship, consulting, investing, & community building, as well as through the traditional non-profit or for-profit pathways. By providing resources to students about the landscape of the social impact sector & structure, we hope to strengthen the community of like-minded students in their pursuit of impactful careers. We envision Spark Social Impact as a stepping stone to helping student leaders dedicate their careers to innovative change.
  </p>
  <h2>GOALS</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is for students & young professionals to use this platform to learn about the social impact landscape, explore possible career pathways, & pursue opportunities that help cultivate change in their field.
  </p>
  <h3 class="about-subtitle">Spark Knowledge and Awareness</h3>
  <p>
    Through this centralized collection of social impact organizations, we aim to democratize knowledge of the vibrancy of the social impact space. We believe that the lack of awareness and fragmentation of mission-driven organizations results to lower levels of youth involvement in the social impact scene. We aim to create access by bridging knowledge with curious and passionate students and young professionals.
  </p>
  <h3 class="about-subtitle">Spark Connections</h3>
  <p>
    With renewed knowledge on the exciting dynamics of the impact space, we hope that this becomes the first stepping stone in creating community with like-minded individuals but also a pathway to connect with organizations.
  </p>
  <h3 class="about-subtitle">Spark Action</h3>
  <p class="about-paragraph">
    This is a platform which enables people of all age and backgrounds to be proactive in finding ways to be involved in the organizations of interest. We encourage those who benefits from this platform to reach out to the organizations and actively seek out opportunities.
